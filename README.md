# For a Better School (Pour une Ecole Meilleure)
A community project dedicated to improve student conditions in an international high school. Check it out [here](https://thurinum.github.io/for-a-better-school/).

Prompted by a young teacher and organized by the school's 2020-2021 graduates, the project combined the efforts of over a hundred students 
who denounced, through presentations, letters, videos, and a manifest, work overload and lack of communication between the school board and its students.

This website was my first experience in making a full-fledged website and was created in partnership with another student, Yessine Chaari, who provided the webpage's design and wireframes as well as writing the content.  
It makes many references to the [IB's Learner Profile](https://www.ibo.org/contentassets/fd82f70643ef4086b7d3f292cc214962/learner-profile-en.pdf).

Oh, and it implements the following custom JS gimmicks:

- Foreground+background parallax
- Wonky but working carousel system for embedding documents
- Fetch() quotes from JSON every page reload
- Half-finished responsive design
- Typewriter effect on headers
- Attempt at design
- And more...

The original website included unpublished content from fellow students. I have removed it from this repository.
Some public content (e.g. public youtube videos) remains.
